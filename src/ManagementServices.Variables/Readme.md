# Environment Variable Management Project Documentation

This project is a library system for managing environment variables. It allows developers to add, update, delete, and query environment variables in a database. The system is flexible and enables you to use dependency injection to configure database repositories.

## Main Classes

### `EnvVariable` Class

The `EnvVariable` class is the primary model for representing an environment variable. It contains the following attributes:

- `Key` (string): The key of the environment variable.
- `Value` (string): The value associated with the key of the environment variable.

This class inherits from the `Entity` class, which provides validation and cloning functionality.

### `EnvVariableRepository` Class

The `EnvVariableRepository` class is responsible for interacting with the database for operations related to environment variables. It contains the following main methods:

- `Add`: Adds an environment variable to the database.
- `AddRange`: Adds a list of environment variables to the database.
- `Get`: Retrieves an environment variable based on the key.
- `GetByFilter`: Retrieves a list of environment variables based on a filter expression.
- `Update`: Updates an environment variable in the database.
- `Delete`: Deletes an environment variable based on the key.
- `DeleteRange`: Deletes a list of environment variables based on a list of keys.

## Usage

To use this environment variable management system in your project, follow these steps:

1. Install the corresponding NuGet package for the library in your project.

2. Configure dependency injection for the `EnvVariableRepository` with the appropriate database context. To do this, you may need to create an intermediate repository that receives methods from `EnvVariableRepository`.

3. Use the methods of the `EnvVariableRepository` to perform CRUD operations on environment variables in the database.
